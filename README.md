### ⚠️ It is highly recommended that you *do not* use these plate files with an aftermarket Filco Majestouch 2 TKL PCB as there is *zero* guarantee that such PCBs will be compatible with this plate, or other Phantom TKL derived plate files, due to differences in switch/clustre spacing and or stabilizer orientation ⚠️

# What is this?
These are modified [Phantom TKL keyboard plate files](https://github.com/mohitg11/GH-CAD-Resources) with a *completely fixed* layout, and a controller cutout that makes these compatible with OEM Filco Majestouch 2 TKL PCBs.  
***Only compatible with all south-facing & plate-mounted Cherry stabilizers, and the default US-ANSI Majestouch 2 TKL keyboard layout.***  

## Why are there 2 plate files available?
***There are 2 versions of this plate:***  
One with the *unchanged* screw cutouts from the original Phantom TKL plate files

And one with slightly tighter screw cutouts that *should* theoretically work (although this currently *has not* been tested)

I personally would use the tighter screw tolerance version for a better building experience, but do so ***at your own risk*** until it's confirmed to fit.  
*(See the photos below, there is some space for the plate to move around horizontally, and thus some of the screws aren't perfectly centered on the plate. **This is a thing on the OEM plate as well** for unknown reasons)*

Also yes, this means that the plate files are confirmed to fit.
